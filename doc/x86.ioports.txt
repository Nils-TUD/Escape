		XT, AT and PS/2	 I/O port addresses

      Do NOT consider this information as complete and accurate.
      If you want to do harware programming check ALWAYS the
      appropriate data sheets. Be aware that erroneously programming
      can put your hardware or your data at risk. 

      There is a memory mapped address in use for I/O functions of which I
      think it should be mentioned here. See at the end of this list.
